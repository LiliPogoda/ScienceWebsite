# The ionproduct of water

TODO: Asthetics pic water

What makes a solution acidic or basic. As you might think it is not the compound itself that is acidic or basic. So pure Hydrogenchloride is actually not acidic. What actual is acidic is the protons when the acid get ionised in a solution:
(TODO: ionisation HCL)
So creating a solution by mixing it with water is what makes it acidic. Because only then the acid ionises. You might be wondering why in the equation
it says H$_3$0$^+$. This is because in solution protons are exiting in a hydrated form yielding h30+ cations also called hydroniumion.
The same goes for a base. What actually makes the solution basic is the presence of of oh- anions. Hence the amount of these ions is responsible for how basic or acidic a solution is.

How many of these ions are present in our solution depends on how willingly that acid or base dissolves. This can be explained wit the equilibria of the reaction equations.
So in order to predict the state of the ionisation of solutes in water we need to take into considerations all the relevant equilibrium constants for each ionization reaction.

First and formost we will tackle water:

It is known that water is a good conductor of electricity. This is due to all the ions that are dissolved in it like sodium,chloride...etc.
But even when you remove all these ions from the water and end up with a 100% pure water your water would still be able to conduct electricity.
But how is that possible ? I mean you only have uncharged watermolecules right? Well that is not entirely true. Water has the tendency to undergo a reversible ionization:

TODO: Autoprotolyse wasser rx equ.

To get an idea of the ionization of water in quantitative terms we need to take a look at chemical euqilibrium of water: (TODO link chemical equ.)



The equation for the ionization:
TODO: equ. for ionization

Now this expressed in an equilibrium equation:
TODO: equlibrium equ.

**$\text{Test}$**

In pure water at 25 degrees celcius the concerntration of water is 55.5M (grams of H20 in 1L divided by its gram molecular weight: (1000g/L)/(18.015g/mol))

TODO: equ.

The concentration of H20 can be assumed as constant as the concentrations of H3o+ and OH- are very small. Upon rearranging we get:

TODO: equ.

The product K$_w$ is called the ion product of water. K$_eq$ of pure water was measured and is: 1.8 x 10$^-16$. Inserting this into the equation:

TODO: equ.  

K$_w$ is is constant so the product of [H+][OH-] is always equals to 1x10$^-14$ M$^2$. For the water to be neutral - neither acidic nor basic - the concentrations of both have to be equal.
In a neutral solution the concentrations can be calculated:

TODO: euqation

As a cosequence of K$_w$ being constant the concentrations of [H+] and [OH-] adjust accordingly: So if the concentration of [H+] is very high the concentration of [OH-] is accordingly low.

Now how is this important in order to measure how strong an acid is or how acidic our solution is? The ion product directly relates to the pKa and the pH. What exactly they are and how they work is described in a flamboyant fashion in the next blogpost of this series.
