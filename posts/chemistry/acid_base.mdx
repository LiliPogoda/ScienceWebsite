TODO: Oceanopic
The acid base chemistry is a big part of chemistry. Acid base reactions happen everywhere: In nature, our bodies and in a mostly very distorted form also on television.
To be quite fair the first thing that was popping into my mind was dissolving bodies like in breaking bad or batman. But I really do not want to spend the whole time while writing this article 
about bodies being dissolved in acid, because that might be rather unpleasant.
But there is another very very important example: the acidification of our oceans. Why are our oceans becoming more acidic though? A rough explanations is the following: It generally known that the Carbon dioxide levels (CO$_2%)
in our atmosphere have skyrocketed since the beginning of the industrial revolution. The oceans absorb around 30% of the CO$_2$ emissions. Upon getting dissolved in the ocean a series of acid base reactions happen so that the ocean becomes more acidic.
Now as reliable as nature is the ocean is able to dissolve a certain amount of CO$_2$. But the delicate equilibrium is at this point just overwhelmed with the big amount of human produced emissions. A 30% increase of acidity has been observed. The result of this 
is grave: The whole environment and their inhabitants are affected. The best example is the great barrier reef in front of the eastcoast of australia. Once white and flourishing now looks like a white skeleton due to the increasing acidity.
But in order to understand this process and to perhaps find solutions for this crises we need to take a deeper dive into the chemistry of things. 
The goal of this blogpost is to familiarise you with the basic knowledge of acid base reactions: What is acidity actually and how does it work?
What exactly does the pH- scale tell us? To find out there is a phenomenal blogpost ahead of you.
