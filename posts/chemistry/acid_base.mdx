TODO: Oceanopic
The acid base chemistry is a big part of chemistry. Acid base reactions happen everywhere: In nature, our bodies and in a mostly very distorted form also on television.
To be quite fair the first thing that was popping into my mind was dissolving bodies like in breaking bad or batman. But I really do not want to spend the whole time while writing this article 
about bodies being dissolved in acid, because that might be rather unpleasant.

But there is another very very important example: the acidification of our oceans. Why are our oceans becoming more acidic though? A rough explanations is the following: 
It generally known that the Carbon dioxide levels (CO$_2$) in our atmosphere have skyrocketed since the beginning of the industrial revolution. 
The oceans absorb around 30% of the CO$_2$ emissions. Upon getting dissolved in the ocean a series of acid base reactions happen so that the ocean becomes more acidic.
Now as reliable as nature is the ocean is able to dissolve a certain amount of CO$_2$. But the delicate equilibrium is at this point just overwhelmed with the big amount of human produced emissions. A 30% increase of acidity has been observed. The result of this 
is grave: The whole environment and their inhabitants are affected. The best example is the great barrier reef in front of the east coast of australia. Once colorful and flourishing now looks like a white skeleton due to the increasing acidity.

But in order to understand this process and to perhaps find solutions for this crisis we need to take a deeper dive into the chemistry of things. 
The goal of this blog post is to familiarize you with the basic knowledge of acid base reactions: What is acidity actually and how does it work?
What exactly does the pH- scale tell us? To find out there is a phenomenal blog post ahead of you. 


# Definition

Now there are different theories describing acid base chemistry: The Arrehnius definition, the Brønsted-Lowry definition and the Lewis definition.
In general it might be best to think of these models as theories that complement each other: The Lewis model as a rather broad definition, the the Brønsted-Lowry definition being 
already a tat more specific and finally the Arrehnius definition which is the most restricted one. 

Here I will first tackle only the Brønsted-Lowry definition. It is the most comfortable one to begin with when learning about the Acid and Base chemistry. (TODO: link Lewis acid base chem and HASB prinziep)

Brønsted and Lowry thought of acid base reactions as a Proton transfer reaction. A proton is a Hydrogenion with the charge of +1: It carries no electrons.
The species that looses a proton is defined as an acid and the species that gains a proton is a base. From this a general definition arises:

Any species that has a Hydrogenatom can potentially act as an acid

Any species that has a lone pair of electrons can act as a base.

Upon loosing the proton the acid turns into its conjugate Base. The other way around the base receiving the proton turns into its conjugate acid.(TODO:explain relationship later:the stronger the acid the weaker conj. base)
TODO:reaction formula showing all the named stuff

You might notice that it is possible for some compounds to act as an acid and a base. The best example is water: It can give but also receive a proton. This is called an amphotheric compound.

# The ionproduct of water

What makes a solution acidic or basic. As you might think it is not the compound itself that is acidic or basic. So pure Hydrogenchloride is actually not acidic. What actual is acidic is the protons when the acid get ionised in a solution:
(TODO: ionisation HCL)
So creating a solution by mixing it with water is what makes it acidic. Because only then the acid ionises. You might be wondering why in the equation
it says H$_3$0$^+$. This is because in solution protons are exiting in a hydrated form yielding h30+ cations also called hydroniumion.
The same goes for a base. What actually makes the solution basic is the presence of of oh- anions. Hence the amount of these ions is responsible for how basic or acidic a solution is.

How many of these ions are present in our solution depends on how willingly that acid or base dissolves. This can be explained wit the equilibria of the reaction equations.
So in order to predict the state of the ionisation of solutes in water we need to take into considerations all the relevant equilibrium constants for each ionization reaction.

First and formost we will tackle water:

It is known that water is a good conductor of electricity. This is due to all the ions that are dissolved in it like sodium,chloride...etc.
But even when you remove all these ions from the water and end up with a 100% pure water your water would still be able to conduct electricity.
But how is that possible ? I mean you only have uncharged watermolecules right? Well that is not entirely true. Water has the tendency to undergo a reversible ionization:

To get an idea of the ionization of water in quantitative terms we need to take a look at chemical euqilibrium of water: (TODO link chemical equ.)
