TODO: Fireflypic aesthetic

Sadly these dazzling beetles and their famous lights are vanishing all around our planet.
This is due to loss of their natural habitat, pesticides and light pollution. This thought is quite saddening as they and especially their ability to glow was always something that kept me wondering when I was small.
Even though there is less magic involved than the little me actually thought the actual chemical process is still a very magical one:
Bioluminescence - The production and emission of light by living organisms.

The fireflies are the most well-known and studied bioluminescent organisms. Responsible for the light production is a special enzyme-substrate system: The firefly luciferase (enzyme) and the luciferin (substrate).
The enzyme catalyses the conversion of firefly luciferin into an oxidized exited state. When it returns to the ground state Energy in form of light is released.

## The structures of the Luciferase and the Luciferin

#### The Luciferase:

{displayLuciferase()}

The protein structure consists of two compact domains: a larger N-terminal domain and a smaller C-terminal domain linked through a flexible linker peptide. Feel free to explore this in the Figure above.
The amino acids of the two domains that face each other in the cleft are conserved in the family superfamily of adenylate forming enzymes.
This is a strong pointer that the cleft is the active side of the protein where the actual catalytic reaction takes place. The cleft seems far two big for a simultaneous interactions between the residues on both sides and the the substrates.
Hence it is suggested that both domains undergo a conformational change and close the substrate in like sandwich.
This would provide the perfect conditions for the reaction: Water is excluded and can not react with the ATP nor the exited-state product.
But but where and how exactly it works is yet to be determined.

#### The Luciferin

The luciferin (TODO: picture)

As shown in the picture above the firefly luciferin (D-LH$_2$) consists of 2 moieties: The benzothiazol moiety on the left and the Thiazoline_carboxylic acid moiety on the right.

## The mechanism:

The chemical reaction can roughly be divided two steps:

:::div{class="box"}

1. $\text{Luciferase} + \text{ATP-Mg}^+ + \text{D-LH}_2 \to \text{Luciferase} + \text{LH}_2\text{-AMP} + \text{PP}_i-\text{Mg}^+$

:::

In the first step the firefly luciferase catalyses the reaction of luciferin(D-LH$_2$) and Adenosintriphosphate (ATP). That forms Luciferyl adenylate (LH$_2$-AMP).

:::div{class="box"}

2. $\text{LH}_2\text{-AMP} + \text{O}_{2} \to \text{OL} + \text{AMP} + \text{CO}_2 + \text{\textit{light}} $

:::

The Luciferyl adenylate undergoes oxidation and cyclization and forms a peroxide: Dioxetanone. The decomposition of the dioxetanone intermediate is the essential part for light emission.
But how exactly the dioxetanone gets decomposed is still a subject of debate as there are multiple mechanisms suggested. Nevertheless its suggested
that the dioxetanone undergoes a decarboxylation reaction for yield the light emitting exited oxyluciferin(OL$^*$) as well as Carbondioxide and Adenosinemonophosphate (AMP).
As soon as Oxyluciferin from its exited state to a relaxed ground state(OL) the emission of light happens.
A green to yellow bioluniscent light gets emitted. This is what makes the fireflys glow.

TODO: Shortened mechanism figure

If this description until now kept you on the edge of your seat... there is the full mechanism broken down in detail for you ahead. 

TODO: STep no. 1 fig.
The first step is the adenylation step. The luciferase catalyses a S$_N$2 reaction of luciferin and ATP: The oxygen acts as nucleophile and 
attacks the highly electrophilic alpha phosphate of ATP. This leads to the displacement of the inorganic Pyrophosphate, which is by the way an exellent leaving group!
TODO: Link to explanation of SN2 mechanism.
Why the Magnesium-coordination?
Its actually a very common strategy also used in the synthesis of DNA/RNA. (TODO: RNA/DNA synthesis)
In this cae it enhances the electrophilicity of the alpha phosphorus atom as well as the stabilization of the Pyrophosphate by shielding the negative charges and
influencing the conformation of the phosphate groups. (TODO: what is meant here by influencing the conformation.)

TODO: Step no.2fig.
The presence of the AMP substantially increases the acidity of Proton on Carbon-4 of the thiazoline ring. 
This happens because it is delocalising the negative charge that would result from its abstraction.
Now thats exactly why the luciferase catalyses the deprotonation that yields an Carbanion at carbon-4. This carbanion is stabelized not only by the AMP but also by
its conjugated system to its left.
Now the oxidative step happens: The carbanion attacks molecular oxygen to form hydrperoxide. 


TODO: Step no.3.fig.
Now the Hydroperoxide attacks the carbonylcarbon and they form a 4-membered ring. This is a favorable process, because of the nucleophilic acyl substitution and the 
loss of AMP, which is a very good leaving group. We end up with an alpha-peroxy lactone (a dioxetanone). As I mentioned earlier: The dioxetanone is a high enegery inermediate and a conserved motif
in many reactions involving chemiluminescence.

TODO.step no.4fig.
Nevertheless the exact mechanism of the decomposition of dioxatanone is still in debate. The following steps will showcase one of the suggested approaches.
It is suggested that through Resonance the rightmost nitrogen atom gets an anionic character. So it can then participate in a radical reaction: 
The high energy peroxide bond gets cleaved homolytically and one electron from the Nitrogen gets donated to the Oxygen on Carbon-4 so that we end up up with the diradical shown above.
   

TODO:step no.5fig.
The diradical is very unstable and undergoes spontanous decarboxylation yielding carbondioxide. Now the exited oxyluciferin was formed. The exited of the molecule is shown in green
the two unpaired electrons combine. The version above is the keto version but the formation of the enol version is possible as well as depicted in in fig. (TODO)

TODO:step no6.fig.
Now through some resonance the excited version oxyanionic luciferin gets restored. Which then falls back into the ground state emitting a photon.
In this  step the bioluminescence gets produced so that our firefly can glow.

Now I hope you did enjoy your journey through this mechanism and hope it left you just as much in awe as it left me.
