TODO:Fireflypic asthetic

Sadly these dazzeling beetles and their famous lights are vanishing all around our planet.
This is due to loss of their natural habitat, pesticides and light pollution. This thought is quite saddening as they and esepcially their abililty to glow was always something that kept me wondering when I was small.
Even though there is less magic involved than the little me actually thought the actual chemical prcess is still a very magical one:
Bioluminiscence - The production and emission of light by living organisms.

The fireflies are the most well-known and studied bioluminscent organisms. Responsible for the light prdocuction is a special enzyme-substrate system: The firefly luciferase (enzyem) and the luciferin (substrate).
The enzyme catalyses the conversion of firefly luciferin into an oxidised exited state. When it returns to the ground state Energy in form of light is realeased.

The luciferin (TODO:picture and description)

The chemical reaction takes place is in two steps:

1. Luciferase + ATP-Mg+ + luciferin -> Luciferase + luciferyladenylate + PPi-Mg+
2. luciferyladenylate + O2 -> oxyluciferin + AMP + light (TODO: Explain abbriviations)

Mechanism in detail:<Button>Test</Button>

The firefly dioxetanone, which is a peroxide, is the intermediate in firefly bioluminescence, and its decomposition is the most important step leading to the emission of visible light by a firefly.
However, the firefly dioxetanone decomposition mechanism has never been explored at a reliable theoretical level, because the decomposition process includes biradical, charge-transfer (CT) and se
