TODO:Fireflypic asthetic

Sadly these dazzling beetles and their famous lights are vanishing all around our planet.
This is due to loss of their natural habitat, pesticides and light pollution. This thought is quite saddening as they and esepcially their abililty to glow was always something that kept me wondering when I was small.
Even though there is less magic involved than the little me actually thought the actual chemical prcess is still a very magical one:
Bioluminiscence - The production and emission of light by living organisms.

The fireflies are the most well-known and studied bioluminscent organisms. Responsible for the light prdocuction is a special enzyme-substrate system: The firefly luciferase (enzyem) and the luciferin (substrate).
The enzyme catalyses the conversion of firefly luciferin into an oxidised exited state. When it returns to the ground state Energy in form of light is realeased.

## The structures of the Luciferase and the Luciferin

#### The Luciferase:

{displayLuciferase()}

The protein structure consists of two compact domains: a larger N-terminal domain and a smaller C-terminal domain linked through a flexible linker peptide. Feel free to explore this in the Figure above.
The aminoacids of the two domains that face each other in the cleft are conserved in the family superfamily of adenylate forming enzymes.
This is a strong pointer that the cleft is the active side of the protein where the actual catalytic reaction takes place. The cleft seems far two big for a simultaneous interactions between the residues on both sides and the the substrates.
Hence it is suggested that both domains undergo a conformational change and close the substrate in like sandwich.
This would provide the perfect conditions for the reaction: Water is excluded and can not react with the ATP nor the exited-state product.
But but where and how exactly it works is yet to be determined.

#### The Luciferin

The luciferin (TODO:picture and description)

The chemical reaction takes place is in two steps:

1. Luciferase + ATP-Mg+ + luciferin -> Luciferase + luciferyladenylate + PPi-Mg+
2. luciferyladenylate + O2 -> oxyluciferin + AMP + light (TODO: Explain abbriviations)

## The mechanism:

TODO: Shortened mechanism figure

Mechanism in detail:<Button>Test</Button>

The firefly dioxetanone, which is a peroxide, is the intermediate in firefly bioluminescence, and its decomposition is the most important step leading to the emission of visible light by a firefly.
However, the firefly dioxetanone decomposition mechanism has never been explored at a reliable theoretical level, because the decomposition process includes biradical, charge-transfer (CT) and se
