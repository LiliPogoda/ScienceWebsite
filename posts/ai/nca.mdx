# The Math behind the NCA

We define the NCA as a $W \times H$ grid of $|Z|$-dimensional vectors. $|Z|$ denotes the dimensionality of the latent space,
($H$,$W$) the height and width of the image, respectively. To get the starting state of the grid, we sample a
latent vector $z_\theta \sim q_\phi(z|x)$ and set it as the value of each NCA cell. We simulate the evolution of the NCA for
$T = [K,K +\triangle K]$ time steps, with $K$ being the minimum amount of steps. At each step, an additive update
$z_{i,t} = z_{i,t-1} +u_\theta({z_{j,t-1}}j\in N(i))$ is applied to each cell $z_i$
. $N(i)$ refers to the Moore neighborhood of cell $i$. $u_\theta$
is the parameterized update function of the NCA. In the VNCA model, $u_\theta$ is implemented through a CNN
with learnable parameters $\theta$. The CNN first applies a $3\times 3$ convolution and then alternates between $1\times 1$
convolutional layers and non-linear activations.
