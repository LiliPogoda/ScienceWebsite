For Advanced Readers: The Mechanism behind the EFF:

We define:

- $u(t)$ , the microscopic, detailed solution to the system. Assume that $u$ is a system of ODEs, $u \in \mathbb{R}^m$
- $\mathcal{T}_d$ , the detailed timestepper - equation that provides the microscopic solution
- $\mathcal{T}_d^t = u(s + t)$, the detailed timestepper mapping the system state at time $s$ to the state at time $s+t$
- $U \in \mathbb{R}^M$, $M \ll m$, the selected coarse description of the system. E.g. in a gas simulation: pressure, density, velocity.
- $\mathcal{M}$, the _restriction_ operator. Maps a microscopic state $u$ to the corresponding macroscopic state $U$ such that $U = \mathcal{M}u$
- $\mu$ , the _lifting_ operator. Maps a macroscopic state $U$ onto a consistent microscopic state $u$ such that $\mathcal{M}\mu = I$. This means, _lifting_ is fully reversible through _restriction_.
Note, that in most cases $\mu$ is not unique. This is due to multiple realizability of the system (e.g. two different pairs of velocities can map onto the same average velocity.)

The idea here is that if $U$ describes the macroscopic system successfully, the remaining system quantities should be approximable as functions of $U$.
That means, we should be able to map from $U$ onto a $m$-dimensional manifold approximating $u$. On this manifold, the components of U would vary slowly.
We further define:

- $\mathcal{T}_c^\tau$ , The coarse timestepper. Equation that governs the macroscopic dynamics. We **don't** have a closed form solution for this.
- $\tau > 0$ , the time horizon of the coarse stepper. Choose small enough that it is tractable to calculate $\mathcal{T}_d^{\tau}$, but long enough for the macroscopic dynamics to evolve meaningfully

Using the given definitions, we can further define the coarse timestepper $\mathcal{T}_c^\tau$ as:

### $\mathcal{T}_c^\tau = \mathcal{M}\mathcal{T}_d^{\tau}\mu$

In words, the macroscopic timestepper works by:

1. Mapping the macroscopic state onto a microscopic manifold $u$
2. Using the detailed timestepper to evolve the microscopic state for $\tau$ timesteps
3. Mapping the resulting microscopic state back into a macroscopic description $U$

The authors note that after an initial "warmup" period $s$, the dynamics of this timestepper will approximately approach the real dynamics of the macroscopic complex system. Thus,
we assume that $U(t + s) \approx \mathcal{M}\mathcal{T}_d^s u(t)$.

This allows us to do "short time" simulations of the system.

TODO: Coarse Projective integration

So far, the method has only addressed the temporal aspect of the system. However, the behavior of many complex systems also has a spatial dependency.
Space here refers to the domain of the variable and while it could mean physical space, it could also refer to frequencies, probabilities, etc. To address the spatial dependencies,
the authors of [1] have come up with the "gap-tooth" scheme. The scheme enables "small space, short time" simulations of the macroscopic system. The goal is to combine it with the Coarse
Projective Integrator to enable "large space, large time" simulations. We again consider $u(t)$ to be a microscopic description of a macroscopic system $U(t)$. However, $u$ is now connected
to spatial points and there is a set of boundary conditions. If we want to solve for $u$ in a larger space, the dimensionality of the problem also grows. It follows that we can only solve $u$
for small spaces. We need to extend our definitions as follows:

- $U(t, x) = \mathcal{M}u(t)$, the _lifting_ operator $\mathcal{M}$ now maps microscopic states $u(t)$ onto a function $U(t,x)$ that is continuous in the spacial variable $x$.
- $U_t = L(t, x, U, \partial_x U, \dots, \partial_x^p U)$ , U is an evolution equation of the complex system. A macroscopic state $U_t$ can be defined as some function $L$
depending on the time $t$, space $x$, the evolution equation $U$ and its $p$ higher order derivatives. There is no closed form solution available for this equation.
