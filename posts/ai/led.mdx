<h1>Complexity on multiple scales</h1>

Nature Science at large can simply be defined as the study of nature phenomena. That definition is neither special nor surprising.
But I find it helpful to recall it, if purely to remember that the different disciplines, Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Math, are
the same thing at heart. What differs is the scale of the phenomena under analysis. Each discipline represents a layer of abstraction
through which they view nature. Biologists tend to consider organisms, while Chemists work on the level of proteins, molecules and atoms.

Complex systems, like nature, can often be separated into processes at multiple levels of abstraction, with the low level processes culminating in
the emergence of higher-level behavior. An example for this is the analysis
of protein dynamics. At a high level, we can describe the interaction between different proteins. Each protein then is an abstraction for a system
of amino acids interacting with each other. The dynamics of the amino acid interactions on the smaller scale leads to the emergence of the protein behaviors
on a larger scale. Going even further, we can see each amino acid as a system of molecules exhibiting molecular dynamics.

<h1>Complex Systems are hard to simulate</h1>

Previous efforts have shown that resolving the full range of scales in complex
systems will remain out of reach in the foreseeable future. However, as with all things mathematical: if you can't do the real thing, approximate it.
In order to be successful, we need to distinguish what the main difficulties are. [1] distinguish
two key problems:

1. Finding the scales that are important to the overall system dynamics
2. Transferring information between the processes happening at different scales

Multiple frameworks have been introduced that try to solve the two issues. A particularly popular example is the Equation-Free framework (EFF). Goal of the EFF is to
simulate a macroscopic complex system, for which we **don't** have a model available. What we do have, presumably, is models for the underlying processes
at finer scales [2]. E.g.: We have a model for molecular dynamics but we don't have a model available for protein interaction. Because the macroscopic phenomena arise
from the low level processes, the EFF presumes that we should be able to derive a macroscopic model from the known, low level processes.

For Advanced Readers: The Mechanism behind the EFF:

We define:

- $u(t)$ , the microscopic, detailed solution to the system. Assume that $u$ is a system of ODEs, $u \in \mathbb{R}^m$
- $\mathcal{T}_d$ , the detailed timestepper - equation that provides the microscopic solution
- $\mathcal{T}_d^t = u(s + t)$, the detailed timestepper mapping the system state at time $s$ to the state at time $s+t$
- $U \in \mathbb{R}^M$, $M \ll m$, the selected coarse description of the system. E.g. in a gas simulation: pressure, density, velocity.
- $\mathcal{M}$, the _restriction_ operator. Maps a microscopic state $u$ to the corresponding macroscopic state $U$ such that $U = \mathcal{M}u$
