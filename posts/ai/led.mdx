<h1>Complexity on multiple scales</h1>

Researchers in various disciplines (Chemistry, Physics, Biology, ...) are interested in the study of complex systems. The dynamics
of these systems often depend on space and time on more than a single scale. I.e., the observable system dynamics depend on the
scale of time and space at which the system is analyzed. An example for this is global warming. Fig. 1 shows the annual sea surface temperature, recorded
between 1850 and 2020. The researchers have analyzed the trends of this data at different time scales and different complexities.

Another way to look at it, is that systems can be described at multiple levels of abstraction. An example for this is the analysis
of protein dynamics. At a high level, we can describe the interaction between different proteins. Each protein then is an abstraction for a system
of amino acids interacting with each other. The dynamics of the amino acid interactions on the smaller scale leads to the emergence of the protein behaviors
on a larger scale. Going even further, we can see each amino acid as a system of molecules exhibiting molecular dynamics.

<h1>Complex Systems are hard to simulate</h1>

Previous efforts have shown that resolving the full range of spatio-temporal scales in complex
systems will remain out of reach in the foreseeable future. However, as with all things mathematical: if you can't do the real thing, approximate it.
Multiple systems have been introduced to do just that. In order to be successful
