Education is a basic human need. From the first minute of our lifes we begin to process information. It should be available and in reach for everyone. And that in a very good form.
Growing up in germany you it should be a given that everyone has the same starting point and and outlook education wise. But even in a highly developed country that is just not true. Your social and financial background already determines a lot. 
Children from socially better situated families have it easier to find their way into education and the academic world. We think every single individuum has the right to a good education. 
Problem academia: bad teaching/bad academia; publish or perish -> bad education people dont enjoy science. BUt  crucial part of our lives. Everything is science. We know nothing. Discovery. Share love and passion. New ways to show things. Anumations and visualisation . for better way of teaching. Interactive.

My name is Philine Pogoda. I am a chemistry student. The root of my desire and deep passion for sharing the world of chemistry in the wonderful way I experience is that
I want people to experience chemistry and science as a beautiful thing. Already graduating from High school i saw the trend of people absolutly banning chemistry from their minds.
It was that horrible subject that you just want to pass and get over with: Its hard and uncomfortable and just not very exiting.
