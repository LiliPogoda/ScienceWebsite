Education is a basic human need. From the first minute of our lifes we begin to process information. It should be available and in reach for everyone. And that in a very good form.
Growing up in germany you it should be a given that everyone has the same starting point and and outlook education wise. But even in a highly developed country that is just not true. Your social and financial background already determines a lot. 
Children from socially better situated families have it easier to find their way into education and the academic world.
