*"Studying and striving for truth and beauty in general, is a sphere in which we are allowed to stay children throughout life"* - Albert Einstein

Education is a basic human need. From the first minute of our lifes we begin to process information. It should be available and in reach for everyone. 
Unfortunately this is not always a given. Our access to education is determined by our financial and social background in most cases. We think every single individuum has the right to a good education. 
There is another problem with education these days. Most educational institutions are failing to educate. The unhealthy "publish or perish" mentality under researchers takes not only an enormous toll on the researchers themselves. It also is affecting the teaching of students harshly. The quality of education provided is not the best.
Students begin to struggle and also begin to loathe science thinking the problem is them and that they are just not smart enough. A change in education and how we are taught can make a big difference. The goal of this platform is to find new creative ways that allows anyone from every background to understand scientific phenomena. For that we rely on 
animations and interactive learning. Ultimately we hope that in the process of learning we are able to share our love and passion for the topics and inflict them on the learning person.

My name is Philine. I am currently deeply emersed in my chemistry studies. The root of my desire and deep passion for sharing the world of chemistry in the wonderful way I experience it, is that
I want people to experience chemistry and science as a beautiful thing. It is what makes us up as humans. I think that every human, no matter in which field they are, should be familiar with at least the basic wonders of science and especially chemistry.
Sadly, the education provided in academia is not the most colorful one. In my opinion this is the reason why many fo us already feel already uneasy about STEM topics in school. 
My goal here is to provide education in a way that makes Chemistry and other STEM topics less daunting and maybe even fun and lovely.

My name Is Jan Schering, I am currently finishing my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence with a specialization in Cognitive Computing. My research area is the relatively recent
field of Neural Cellular Automata. I am currently partaking in the ELLIS excellence fellowship program for Master students. My motivation for working on this page is that I love teaching,
explaining, and visualizing things. Just like Philine, I have unfortunately been experiencing that teaching is simply not the main focus of a lot of academic institutions. The material that 
holds so much beauty and could be visualized and explained in so may ways is often simply covered through a slideshow (or a PDF if there was no time to make slides..). I want to share 
what makes me excited about these topics.
