# About this Website

Zitat??
Education is a basic human need. From the first minute of our lifes we begin to process information. It should be available and in reach for everyone. And that in a very good form.
Growing up in germany you it should be a given that everyone has the same starting point and and outlook education wise. But even in a highly developed country that is just not true. Your social and financial background already determines a lot. 
Children from socially better situated families have it easier to find their way into education and the academic world. We think every single individuum has the right to a good education. 
Problem academia: bad teaching/bad academia; publish or perish -> bad education people dont enjoy science. BUt  crucial part of our lives. Everything is science. We know nothing. Discovery. Share love and passion. New ways to show things. Anumations and visualisation . for better way of teaching. Interactive.

My name is Philine Pogoda. I am currently deeply emersed in my chemistry studies. The root of my desire and deep passion for sharing the world of chemistry in the wonderful way I experience it, is that
I want people to experience chemistry and science as a beautiful thing. It is what makes us up as humans. I think that every human, no matter in which field they are, should be familiar with at least the basic wonders of science and especially chemistry.
Sadly, the education provided in academia is not the most colorful one. In my opinion this is the reason why many fo us already feel already uneasy about STEM topics in school. 
My goal here is to provide education in a way that makes Chemistry and other STEM topics less daunting and maybe even fun and lovely.

My name Is Jan Schering, I am currently finishing my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence with a specialization in Cognitive Computing. My research area is the relatively recent
field of Neural Cellular Automata. I am currently partaking in the ELLIS excellence fellowship program for Master students. My motivation for working on this page is that I love teaching,
explaining, and visualizing things. Just like Philine, I have unfortunately been experiencing that teaching is simply not the main focus of a lot of academic institutions. The material that 
holds so much beauty and could be visualized and explained in so may ways is often simply covered through a slideshow (or a PDF if there was no time to make slides..). I want to share 
what makes me excited about these topics.
