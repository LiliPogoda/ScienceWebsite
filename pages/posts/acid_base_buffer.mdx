Many processes in chemistry require a specific and stable pH. Especially most biological systems can only operate at a certain pH. Small changes 
would lead to a big disturbance of the whole system. ??The original goal of this acid-base series was to understand why our ocean is getting more acidic.??

A way to regulate the system and ensure pH stability despite external influences are buffers.
A buffer is an aqueous solution that is able to resist small changes in its pH when small amounts.
of acid ($H^+$) or base ($OH_-$) are added. The system consists of equal amounts of a weak acid and its conjugate base or vice versa and has a certain buffering capacity and range that dictates how much acid or base can be added before the pH changes.
The best example is an acetic acid buffer. The titration curve was covered in the last article of this series (TODO here).

TODO pic titration plot 

IDEA let them play around with values and watch how the plot oer any other viaualization changes? like amount acid and base with buffer capacity.

Now the special thing about the midpoint was that we had equal concentrations of Acetic acid (HAc) and its conjugate base (Ac-) and exactly this makes it a buffer.
Notice that the titration curve is also relatively flat around the midpoint with a range of 1 pH unit upwards and downwards.
This is called the buffering region of the acetic acid-acetate buffer pair. The pH at this point of the titration curve is equal to the pK_a of acetic acid. 

The ability to buffer stems from two reversible reaction equilibria that occur in a solution with equal concentrations of a proton donor and its conjugate proton acceptor. (TODO: sounds to complicated??Do better)
In the case if acetic acid they are the following:


$K_w = [H+][OH-] = 1 x 10^-14 M^2$

$K_a = [H+][Ac-]/[HAc] = 1.74 x 10^-5 M^2$

Reaction equations:

$H20 \rightleftharpoons H+ + OH-$

$HAc \rightleftharpoons H+ + Ac-$

The system is able to absorb either H+ or OH-.

If OH- is added to the system:

TODO: figure with blocks 

Here the "stored" H+ of HAc are released and react with OH- to form H2O. This happens because the product $[H+][OH-]$ exceeds the characteristic constant $K_w = 1 x 10^-14 M^2$
Hence the system reacts by reducing the amount of H+. This has the impact that the quotient $[H+][Ac-]/[HAc]$ is less then $K_a = 1.74 x 10^-5 M^2$. Hence HAc dissociates further to satisfy its characteristic constant.

If H+ is added to the system:

TODO: figure with blocks

In this case the conjugate Base Ac- reacts with the H+ to form HAc. And here again the the two reaction equilibria react so equilibrium is restored.

Hence there is only a very small change in pH due to change in ratio of the relative concentrations:
The decrease in one component means an increase of the other one. The sum does not change, just the ratio.
