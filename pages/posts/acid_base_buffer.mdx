Many processes in chemistry require a specific and stable pH. Especially most biological systems can only operate at a certain pH. Small changes 
would lead to a big disturbance of the whole system. ??The original goal of this acid-base series was to understand why our ocean is getting more acidic.??

A way to regulate the system and ensure pH stability despite external influences are buffers.
A buffer is an aqueous solution that is able to resist small changes in its pH when small amounts
of acid ($H^+$) or base ($OH_-$) are added. The system consists of equal amounts of a weak acid and its conjugate base or vice versa.
The best example is an acetic acid buffer. The titration curve was covered in the last article of this series (TODO here).

Now the special point about the midpoint was that we had equal concentrations of Acetic acid (HAc) and its conjugate base (Ac-) right?
