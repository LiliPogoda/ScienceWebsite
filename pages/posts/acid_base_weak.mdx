Lets take a small detour the first article post. The following happens when we mix Hydrochloric acid with water:

**$$ HCl + H2O -> H3O^+ + Cl^- $$**

You might notice that the arrow of the reaction only goes to the directiom of products. And that exactly is the case: Upon getting dissolved in water Hydrochloric acid dissociates completely. The weight of the reaction equation lies strongly with the products. Remember ffrom the last post: How acidic a solution is
is based on the concentration of H3O+. Because HCL ionises completely in solution it is called a strong acid. 

The same goes for bases: Natriumhydroxide (NaOH) ionises completely in and aqueous solution:

**$$ NaOH + H2O -> H3O^+ + OH^- $$**

Therefore NaOH is a strong base.

What is even more interesting to Biochemists are weak acids and bases. Weak in this case means that they do not dissociate completely in an an aequeous solution. They are crucial for biological systems and play an important roles in in metabolism ans its regulation.

Each weak acid characteristic tendency to loose protons.The stronger the acid the easier the proton will disassociate. The equilibrium constant defines the tendency to loose the proteins.

$ HA \rightleftharpoons H^+ + A^- $

$K_eq = [H+][A-]/[HA] = K_a$ (Acid dissociation constant)

Now taking the negative decadic logarithm we get:

$-log(K_a) = log 1/K_a = pK_a$

Hence we can conclude the stronger the acid the higher its K_a and the lower its pK_a.

How to determine the pK_a via titration will be described in the following part of this article.
Using a titration you can find out the concentration of acid in a given solution. We take a measure volume of acid of unkown concentration and titrate it with a solution of a strong base (eg. NaOH) of known concentration. 
You add NaOH in small Volumes until the acid is neutralized. (This can be determined using an indicator TODO: indicator link or a pH meter)

Once the acid is neutralized it is possible to calculate the concentration of the acid using the Volume of the acid ans well as the volume and concentration of the strong base.

c(acid) x V(acid) = c(base) x V(base)

If we now make a plot of the pH measured against the amount of strong base added we can determine the pKa.

The following graph shows a titration of acetic acid (CH3COOH) with Sodiumhydroxide. 
There are two equilibria involved in the process:

$H20 \rightleftharpoons H+ + OH-$

$HAc \rightleftharpoons H+ + Ac-$

These equilibria ave like mentioned above their own characteristic equilibrium constant which they will "try to maintain".

$K_w = [H+][OH-] = 1 x 10^-14 M^2$

$HAc = [H+][Ac-]/[HAc] = 1.74 x 10^-5 M^2$

To understand what exactly happens we will look at each point of the titration in detail.
TODO: plot 



At the beginning of the titration before any NaOH is added CH3COOH is slightly ionized according to its pK_a value.
When NaOH is added the Hydroxide ions (OH-) are combining with the free H+ in the solution to form H2O to the point where they reaches its characteristic equilibrium constant.

As free $H^+$ are getting removed HAc dissociates more in order to maintain its characteristic equilibrium constant. The equilibrium shifts more to the right.
Hence the more NaOH is added the more HAc dissociates.

The midpoint of the titration is reached when 50% of the NaOH solution have been added. At this point HAc is also 50% disassociated. The concentration of [$HAc$] is equals [$Ac^-$]. 
The interesting thing aboit the midpoint is that it tells you the $pK_a$ of the the acid. And a little algebra will show you why:

 
Setting up the chemical equilibrium for the midpoint:

$K_a = [Ac^-][H^+]/[HAc]$

As [$HAc$] = [$Ac^-$] we can just cross them out. We get:

$K_a = [H^+]/1$

Now taking the negative decadic logarithm:

$pK_a = log[H^+]$

And we know that $log[H^+] = pH$. So at the midpoint the following is true:

$pK_a = pH$
