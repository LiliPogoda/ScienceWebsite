Lets take a small detour the first article post. The following happens when we mix Hydrochloric acid with water:

HCL + H2O -> H3O+ + Cl-

You might notice that the arrow of the reaction only goes to the directiom of products. And that exactly is the case: Upon getting dissolved in water Hydrochloric acid dissociates completely. The weight of the reaction equation lies strongly with the products. Remember ffrom the last post: How acidic a solution is
is based on the concentration of H3O+. Because HCL ionises completely in solution it is called a strong acid. 

The same goes for bases: Natriumhydroxide (NaOH) ionises completely in and aqueous solution:

NaOH + H2O -> H3O + OH-

Therefore NaOH is a strong base.

What is even more interesting to Biochemists are weak acids and bases. Weak in this case means that they do not dissociate completely in an an aequous solution. They are crucial for biological systems and play an important roles in in metabolism ans its regulation.
