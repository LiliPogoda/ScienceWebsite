As a child I would walk through an autumn forest and would try to pick up the most beautiful leaf
 I could find: One with an exceptional vibrant color pattern was preferable.
But everytime I was sure that I have just found the perfect one my eye was caught by a new leave, that seemed even more beautiful than the one I had already in my hand.
Not willing to put away the leave in my hand that I have already gathered I picked up the new one as well. This game went on until I had an arm full of leaves and would bring them home.
My mother was everything but pleased to continuously find big heaps of leafs in my room including all the little inhabitants that deem leaf piles a cozy home.

The subsequent paragraphs will elaborate on why leaves are becoming so colorful and what chemical compounds are responsible for the colors.

I would like to start with a little reminder what exactly color is. If light hits and object it reflects certain wavelengths based on its chemical properties.
While there is a a big spectrum of wavelengths humans only can perceive wavelengths of the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum(TODO: lamda range).

Applying this knowledge to leaves: Why are they green for most of the time? The culprit is a beautiful compound called chlorophyll. The key to compound for photosynthesis. It is found the the chloroplasts
of the leaves.

 While chlorophyll is absorbs red and blue wavelengths it reflects the green wavelengths. We perceive leaves as green. 


The reason behind the color change is connected to the change in season. The amount of daylight decreases and the temperature drops. This triggers leaf abscission (the technical term for dropping of leaves).
In temperate regions this process happens to reduce injury and conserve energy. The abscission process begins with the degradation of chlorophyll induced by hormones from within the trees. 
Chlorophyll gets broken down into smaller compounds that get absorbed by the tree before the leaf falls. 

As the amount of chlorophyll decreases we begin to see the other existing pigments in the leaf that were masked by chlororphyll: Carotenoids and Flavonoids. 
The Carotenoids cause orange coloring. A very known and important molecule involved her is the beta carotene.
A subclass for Carotenoids are the Xanthophylls. They are responsible for the yellow color. A major contibutor  is the Lutein also found in egg yolks. 
The roles of the pigments are ranging from extending the spectrum of light used for photosynthesis to protection and regulation properties. [1] [2] [3]

Another contributor are the anthocyanins (compounds which also belong to the class of Flavonoids). With the beginning of autumn the synthesis of anthocyanins is kick-started giving the leaves shades of red and purple.
They are protecting plants against various biotic (living parts of an ecosystem) and abiotic (non-living parts of an ecosystem) stressors. [4]

Finally after all leaves are dropped the plant goes dormant for the winter month.


Fun fact: Evergreen plants are do not have to drop their leafs. A waxy coating protects their leafs from the harsh winter conditions.
