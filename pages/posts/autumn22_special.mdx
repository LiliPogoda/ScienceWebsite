As a child I would walk through an autumn forest and would try to pick up the most beautiful leaf
 I could find: One with an exceptional vibrant color pattern was preferable.
But everytime I was sure that I have just found the perfect one my eye was caught by a new leave, that seemed even more beautiful than the one I had already in my hand.
Not willing to put away the leave in my hand that I have already gathered I picked up the new one as well. This game went on until I had an arm full of leaves and would bring them home.
My mother was everything but pleased to continuously find big heaps of leafs in my room including all the little inhabitants that deem leaf piles a cozy home.

The subsequent paragraphs will elaborate on why leaves are becoming so colorful and what chemical compounds are responsible for the colors.

I would like to start with a little reminder what exactly color is. If light hits and object it reflects certain wavelengths based on its chemical properties.
While there is a a big spectrum of wavelengths humans only can perceive wavelengths of the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum(TODO: lamda range).

Applying this knowledge to leaves: Why are they green for most of the time? The culprit is a beautiful compound called chlorophyll. The key to compound for photosynthesis. It is found the the chloroplasts
of the leaves.

 While chlorophyll is absorbs red and blue wavelengths it reflects the green wavelengths. We perceive leaves as green. 


The reason behind the color change is connected to the change in season. The amount of daylight decreases and the temperature drops. This triggers leaf abscission (the technical term for dropping of leaves).
In temperate regions this process happens to reduce injury and conserve energy. The abscission process begins with the degradation of chlorophyll induced by hormones from within the trees. 
Chlorophyll gets broken down into smaller compounds that get absorbed by the tree before the leaf falls. 

As the amount of chlorophyll decreases we begin to see the other existing pigments in the leaf that were masked by chlororphyll: Carotenoids and Flavonoids. 
The Carotenoids cause orange coloring. A very known and important molecule involved her is the beta carotene.
A subclass for Carotenoids are the Xanthophylls. They are responsible for the yellow color. A major contibutor  is the Lutein also found in egg yolks. 
The roles of the pigments are ranging from extending the spectrum of light used for photosynthesis to protection and regulation properties. [1] [2] [3]

Another contributor are the anthocyanins (compounds which also belong to the class of Flavonoids). With the beginning of autumn the synthesis of anthocyanins is kick-started giving the leaves shades of red and purple.
They are protecting plants against various biotic (living parts of an ecosystem) and abiotic (non-living parts of an ecosystem) stressors. [4]

Finally after all leaves are dropped the plant goes dormant for the winter month.
Fun fact: Evergreen plants are do not have to drop their leafs. A waxy coating protects their leafs from the harsh winter conditions.

There is an nice technique which which can can be used to extract and separate the different color compounds found in leafs: Chromatography (TODO link chromatography)
The shown technique here is a Thin Layer chromatography (TLC). But the experiment can also be conducted at home with more at hand tools and ingredients (TODO link)

Step1 
a. First the TLC plate is prepared: We draw a pencil line approximately 2cm from the bottom and then set it aside.

b. Grinding the leaf with an extraction solvent in a mortar will breakdown the leaf tissue enabling us to extract the leaf pigments.
   The emerging liquid can now be transferred with the help of a thin capillary tube to the prepared TLC plate.

Step3 
We transfer the liquid inside the tube to the line and repeat this process till we have a concentrated dots of pigments. 
Then under a fume hood we transfer the plate into a beaker which contains solvent for the chromatography and close off the top with a watch glass. (An inexpensive TLC chamber)
The liquid level of the solvent must be below the line with the applied dots. Otherwise our pigment drops would dissolve immediatly.

Step4
Now we come to the interesting part: after placing the plate in the chamber we can observe the liquid traveling up the plate(see video material below):
the plate darkens and seems wet. We can also see the different color pigments traveling up the plate in different speeds so that they ultimately separate.
This aspect of separation is the crackpoint of chromatography. What we see is based on the principle "like dissolves like". What we have is a solvent which is also called the mobile phase (or eluent) and the TLC plate which is the stationary phase. 
We have a relatively apolar solvent and  a relatively polar stationary phase (The TLC plate).Based on the compounds polarity it has a higher or lower affinity for each phase.
The less polar the compound the higher is it affinity for the solvent. Therefore it travels up the TLC plate faster. The more polar a compound is on the other hand the more it is retained on the polar plate and flows up less slowly.


 Based on the given molecular structures match them with the lines seen in the photo on the TLC plate.
