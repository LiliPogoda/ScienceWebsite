This article will discuss the pH scale. The pH scale is a tool to measure how acidic or basic something is. The pH of things is an incredibly important information for us. In our body it affects basically every system we have. The pH affects the structure and functionality of our proteins. 
In the last article I discussed the ionproduct of the water. Why again is that thing important again?
To be able to measure how acid or basic our compound is we need a scale. And for that we have to take in consideration all chemical equilibria who are taking part when an acid or base reacts with water.
So then in the last article we only took a look at water and determined the chemical equilibrium and its konstant: K$_w$ - The ionproduct of water. Now what do we do with this thing? How does it help us to measure anything?

We determined that in a neutral solution the concentrations of H3O+ and OH- both are equals $1.0 * 10^-7$. And K$_w$ is equals $1.0 * 10^-14$ M$^2$. (TODO:equation)
[H30+][OH-]= K$_w$
$(1.0 * 10^-7M) * (1.0 * 10^-7M) = 1.0 * 10^-14 M^2$
These numbers are quite complicated. So to get something that is easier to look on we take the negativ decadic logarithm. (Logarithm to the Base of 10)

Remember:log(A*B)=log(A)+log(B)

$ -log((1.0 * 10^-7M) * (1.0 * 10^-7M))=-log(1.0 * 10^-14 M^2)$

$-log(1.0 * 10^-7M) + -log(1.0 * 10^-7M)=-log(1.0 * 10^-14 M^2)$

$ 7 + 7 = 14 $ or just $ pH + pOH = pK_w $
