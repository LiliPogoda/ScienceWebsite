This article will discuss the pH scale. The pH scale is a tool to measure how acidic or basic something is. For chemists, especially for Biochemists, it is a very important measurement: The pH affects for example the structure and functionality of our proteins in our body.
In the last article I discussed the ionproduct of the water. Why again is that thing important again?
To construct this scale we have to take in consideration all chemical equilibria who are taking part when an acid or base reacts with water.
So then in the last article we only took a look at water and determined the chemical equilibrium and its konstant: K$_w$ - The ionproduct of water. Now what do we do with this thing? How does it help us to measure anything?

We determined that in a neutral solution the concentrations of H3O+ and OH- both are equals $1.0 * 10^-7$. And K$_w$ is equals $1.0 * 10^-14$ M$^2$. (TODO:equation)

[H30+][OH-]= K$_w$

$(1.0 * 10^-7M) * (1.0 * 10^-7M) = 1.0 * 10^-14 M^2$

These numbers are quite complicated. So to get something that is easier to look on we take the negativ decadic logarithm. (Logarithm to the Base of 10)

Remember:log(A*B)=log(A)+log(B)

$ -log((1.0 * 10^-7M) * (1.0 * 10^-7M))=-log(1.0 * 10^-14 M^2)$

$-log(1.0 * 10^-7M) + -log(1.0 * 10^-7M)=-log(1.0 * 10^-14 M^2)$

$ 7 + 7 = 14 $ or just $ pH + pOH = pK_w $

With this knowldege we can proceed to the actual pH scale. The pH reflects the concentration of H+ or more ,because we are talking about a solution, the concentration of H3O+.
These concemtrations can be quite uncomfortable numbers as we saw above . Thats why we take the negative logarithm, which denotes then the "p" in pH.

$ -log(1.0 * 10^-7M) = 7 = pH $

The pH of seven is exactly neutral. This is not a randomly chosen value though. It is as you might already have seen derived from our ionproduct of water.(TODO:Ion product of water link)

Hence solutions having a lower pH than seven are acidic (greater concentration of H3O+) and solutions with a higher pH than 7 are alkaline (greater concentration of OH-)

It is always important to keep in mind that the pH-scale is logarithmic, meaning that a difference in a single pH unit indicates a 10 fold difference in H+ concentration!
