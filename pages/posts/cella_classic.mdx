# Introduction

Galaxy formations, solar systems, biological organisms and the intricate assembly of molecules. The universe is full of complexity at every scale.
In fact, this complexity is so vast that for part of the population, it serves as a proof [[1]](#cred_1) of an intelligent designer (i.e. a "god").
The reasoning behind this thinking is, that something incredibly complex and rich must originate from a deeply intricate source. Complexity cannot
simply appear out of thin air.. or can it? 

While modern variations of Cellular Automata are successfully used in computational Biology, Chemistry, as well as Social Science and other fields, Stephen
Wolfram, in his 2002 book 'A New kind of Science' [[2]](#cred_2), used them to challenge the idea that complexity necessitates a complex source. In this introductory
post, I want to explore the most simple type of Cellular Automata (CA). We will see how even from the most simple rules and initial conditions, richness and complexity
organically arises.
